#+TITLE: Sh - (POSIX) Shell scripts

* How to use the preprocessor
You might notice that some of the shell scripts use code as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#!import module.function
#!import module.*
#+END_SRC

This means that it uses the pp processor, found in pp.c. This preprocessor
imports functions from a <shell-source>.m file so that they are available in the preprocessed output.

** Compilation
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cc -o pp pp.c # or: make pp
#+END_SRC

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
Usage: pp [-hv] [-o OUTFILE] [INFILE...]
  -h   Show this message and exit.
  -v   Enable verbose output.
  -o   Use custom output name instead of default 'outfile'.
#+END_SRC

** Example
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# The following creates out/pushbak.sh from the script utils/pushbak.sh and the module commands.m
pp -o out/pushbak.sh utils/pushbak.sh commands.m # all module files has to be specified, and must end in '.m'
#+END_SRC
